SSB Analytic Views

Analytic views make it easy to extend a star schema with a hierarchical business model,
aggregation and measure calculation rules, presentation and application-specific metadata 
that can be used to enhance the content of a data set and to simplify the development of business intelligence applications.
The SSB schema includes an analytic view and four hierarchies that use the tables of the star schema. Use the following queries to query the analytic Sample SSB view. Note that the analytic view is in the SSB schema.
